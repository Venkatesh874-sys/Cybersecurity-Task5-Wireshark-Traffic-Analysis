# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Internship – Task 5: Wireshark Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Objective
Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark to identify key protocols and understand packet behavior.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Wireshark v4.4.9
- Windows Command Prompt (`ping google.com`)
- Web Browser (for generating HTTP/DNS traffic)

## 📂 Files Included
- `task5_capture.pcapng` – Packet capture file
- `report.pdf` – Detailed analysis report with screenshots
- `screenshots/` – Folder containing protocol screenshots

## 📝 Summary
This task involved capturing ICMP, DNS, TCP, and HTTP packets using Wireshark. Traffic was generated via ping commands and browsing websites. Filters were applied to isolate protocols, and findings were documented in the report.

## 🔍 Key Protocols Observed
- **ICMP** – Ping requests and replies
- **DNS** – Domain name resolution
- **TCP** – Reliable transport layer communication
- **HTTP** – Web traffic and GET requests

## 🚀 How to View
1. Open `task5_capture.pcapng` in Wireshark.
2. Use filters like `icmp`, `dns`, `http`, `tcp` to explore traffic.
3. Refer to `report.pdf` for detailed analysis and screenshots.
